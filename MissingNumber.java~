/** CHANGE LOG
  *  1/26/2015: Started project brainstorming, imported libraries, made preliminary code. Problem with absolute file paths containing the \
  *             character. Considering different language, making it a relative path, other ideas?
  *  1/27/2015: Realized the / character works in place of \, so problems with \ are eliminated. Now there are problems with the last number
  *             being read. Will likely end up making a try/catch block to fix that problem, but implementation details are undecided.
  *  1/28/2015: The problem from yesterday was fixed by using different delimiters. Minor issues (file name containing spaces, filename errors, etc.)
  *             taken care of. Finished error testing. Javadoc comments set up, document cleaned up as a whole.
